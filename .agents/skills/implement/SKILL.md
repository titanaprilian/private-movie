# Implement

Implement the work described by the user in the spec or tickets.

## 0. Get the ticket

This skill runs in a fresh agent with no memory of the conversation that created the ticket — you start with nothing but a reference (an issue number or URL). Before doing anything else, fetch the actual ticket content from GitHub:

```bash
gh issue view <number-or-url> --json title,body,labels,url
```

Consult the **gh-cli** skill if you hit auth/repo-targeting issues or aren't sure which repo to point at — don't guess.

Read the ticket's **"Blocked by"** section. If any blocking ticket isn't closed yet, stop and tell the user rather than implementing out of order.

If the ticket references a **Parent** issue (the spec), fetch that too (`gh issue view <parent-number>`) for full context before starting.

## 1. Implement

Use /tdd where possible, at pre-agreed seams.

Run typechecking regularly, single test files regularly, and the full test suite once at the end.

If the ticket touches backend HTTP endpoints (e.g., routes, middleware, CORS, auth guards), also write and run integration tests under `test/integration/` — not just unit tests. Run `bun run test:integration` from the monorepo root to verify before handing back.

## 2. Hand back

Don't commit any changes that you made. The orchestrator agent is the one who does it. Don't close or edit the GitHub issue yourself — report back what was done and let the orchestrator handle ticket state.
